# HelloWorld
## Description
A more sophisticated way to print 'Hello, World!'. Itâ€™s a cool first program, I suppose... The text moves slowly around the screen, changing colors upon hitting the edges at a controlled pace to reduce visual strain. It leaves a fading trail effect, reminiscent of the classic DVD screensaver. This project uses the Pygame library to handle graphics and animation, ensuring smooth movement and engaging visuals.

- **Bouncing Text**: The text moves around the screen, bouncing off the edges.
- **Dynamic Colors**: The text changes color each time it hits a wall.
- **Fading Trail**: The text leaves a fading trail effect as it moves, enhancing the visual appeal.
